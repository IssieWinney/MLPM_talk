These are the slides from a talk I gave to the department of Computer Science in Sheffield in June 2015. The purpose of the talk was to introduce myself and the services that they can expect from Research Software Engineers at the University.

The presentation uses Reveal.js and the source is available on the gh-pages branch of this repository.
