These are the slides from a talk I gave at the 2015 Summer School for Machine Learning in Personalised Medicine.  http://mlpm.eu/summer-school/summer-school-2015/talks-and-speakers/. The talk is based on ideas in my blog post at http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=5825

The presentation uses Reveal.js and the source is available on the gh-pages branch of this repository.
