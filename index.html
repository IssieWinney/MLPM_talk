							'Research Software Engineer' is a job title that I'm rather proud of as I feel that it closely describes a lot of what I do and it certainly describes what I'll be doing in the future. 

							It's also a job title that I haven't had for very long! Dating from December 1st when the 'RSE' function of Manchester University was officially created. I've had many job titles over the years including

                    The need for groups like this is being recognised nationwide and has already happened in places such as UCL and Manchester. It is in the process of happening elsewhere too.

                One of the great things about working closely with people such as yourselves is that you all help me do it! All of you are doing cutting edge stuff and every time I interact with you, I get to see snippets of your research and the hardware and software technologies you use to do it. Every time I help you a little bit, you help me a little bit. It's all very circular!
