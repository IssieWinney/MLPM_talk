							'Research Software Engineer' is a job title that I'm rather proud of as I feel that it closely describes a lot of what I do and it certainly describes what I'll be doing in the future. 

							It's also a job title that I haven't had for very long! About a month and a half in fact  - dating from December 1st when the 'RSE' function of Manchester University was officially created. I've had many job titles over the years including

						<h2>My road to RSE</h2>

						<li>IT officer

						<li>IT co-ordinator (Scientific Applications)
						<li>Head of EPS Applications Suport
						<li>Research Software Engineer
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
						All these titles and yet the underlying work has been roughly the same for around a decade. It's evolved, to be sure, but the underlying theme that has driven me has been constant.

                        As far as I'm concerned this is the headline act in my new job description at Sheffield and is something that I've been attempting to here at Manchester for quite a while now...with varying degrees of success.

                                  <aside class="notes">The Software Sustainability Institute, of which I am a fellow, has a very apt slogan here - 'Better Software, Better Research'. So ultimately, the aim of roles like mine is to improve research at the University by improving the way its members write and use software.
                                  
                                  So, how can we go about doing this?

                One of the great things about working closely with people such as yourselves is that you all help me do it! All of you are doing cutting edge stuff and every time I interact with you, I get to see snippets of your research and the hardware and software technologies you use to do it. Every time I help you a little bit, you help me a little bit. It's all very circular! 

                Collaboration is the key to a job like this, the role simply would not exist without you and your work.

                        Although 'Research Software Engineering' has been done by many of us for a while now, the job title 'Research Software Engineer' is very new! As far as I know, it's only been a 'thing' since 2012 and Manchester has only had them for almost 2 months! When I go to Sheffield, I'll be their second ever RSE and much of the job description points I've discussed today were created specifically for this new role.

                       The RSE community is just beginning but there is momentum behind it. I don't think we fully understand who we are yet or even what we need to be but I think we are on the right track.

						The picture I've painted today gives you an idea of the kind of RSE I am but I know that there are many other types of RSE out there. Some focus more on the HPC side, others go in really deep in the software engineering side or maybe focus on one language or scientific discipline. Universities such as Sheffield, Manchester and UCL employ RSEs and I'm pretty sure we'll be recruiting more in due course.

						So, if this sounds like the kind of thing you might like to do in the future, stay in touch.
